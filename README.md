# Programming-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for my programs/software/apps/websites which I am looking on expanding to in the future

I started to program about 8 months ago, with HTML and CSS. I would make really basic websites that personally looking back weren't good, but they were a start. In fact, my first site was with no CSS, was not responsive and was crap.

I am now in the progress of learning Python and Machine Learning.
