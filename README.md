# Programming-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for my programs/software/apps/websites which I am looking on expanding to in the future

I started to program about 8 months ago, with HTML and CSS. I would make really basic websites that personally looking back weren't good, but they were a start. In fact, my first site was with no CSS, was not responsive and was crap.

My latest web-app is still a work in progress called All things Men, a site where eventually you will be able to buy products off of. It is built in HTML, CSS, JS, and PhP as the backend service. Eventually I am thinking of changing the language to Python, but I don't really know Python
